# Seattle Airbnb CRISP-DM Project

*Sajid Al Sanai*

**1. Introduction**
I utilise data regarding listings of properties by Airbnb hosts in the city of Seattle (WA) between 2016-2017 for data and regression analysis using the CRISP-DM process. I identify several questions of business interest which I attempt to answer through analysis of the available data.

**2. Data**
Datasets utilised are provided by Airbnb solely for the city of Seattle (WA), divided into (3) CSV files. Of these (3) datasets, I utilise only (2) which are most relevant and useful in analysis:
1. Listings
2. Reviews
3. Calendar (unused)

I have, however, included all (3) datasets above as part of this repository for completeness.

**3. Analysis & Evaluation**
Preliminary analysis of my results are available in the produced notebook. However, a more verbose narrative, analysis, and evaluation are available in my blog post discussing the final results I have obtained.
